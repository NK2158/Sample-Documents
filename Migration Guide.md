## Introduction

### Why Migrate?

NextGen CRM offers a host of new features, improved performance, and a modern user interface designed to enhance your team's productivity. Key benefits include:

*   **Enhanced Automation:** Advanced workflow automation to streamline your business processes.
*   **Improved Analytics:** Deeper insights with our new reporting and dashboard capabilities.
*   **Modern UI/UX:** A more intuitive and user-friendly interface.
*   **Better Integration:** Seamless integration with a wider range of third-party applications.

### Migration Overview

The migration process is divided into four main phases:

1.  **Pre-Migration Planning:** Preparing your data and team for the migration.
2.  **Data Migration:** Moving your data from the Legacy CRM to NextGen CRM.
3.  **Configuration & Customization:** Setting up your new environment.
4.  **Post-Migration Validation:** Ensuring everything is working as expected.

## Phase 1: Pre-Migration Planning

### Migration Checklist

*   [ ] **Identify a Migration Lead:** Designate a point person to oversee the migration process.
*   [ ] **Audit Your Data:** Clean up and archive any unnecessary data in your Legacy CRM.
*   [ ] **Map Your Data:** Identify which data fields from the Legacy CRM will map to which fields in NextGen CRM.
*   [ ] **Schedule the Migration:** Choose a time for the migration that will minimize disruption to your team (e.g., a weekend).
*   [ ] **Communicate with Your Team:** Inform your users about the upcoming migration and any expected downtime.

### Data Backup

**This is a critical step.** Before you begin the migration, perform a full backup of your Legacy CRM data. This will ensure you can restore your data if any issues arise during the migration.

1.  Navigate to `Admin > Data Management` in your Legacy CRM.
2.  Click **Export All Data**.
3.  Select a secure location to store the backup file.

### User Communication

Inform your users about the migration at least one week in advance. Your communication should include:

*   The date and time of the migration.
*   The expected duration of downtime.
*   A brief overview of the benefits of NextGen CRM.
*   Links to training materials and this migration guide.

## Phase 2: Data Migration

### Using the Migration Tool

We have developed a **Migration Tool** to automate the data transfer process. This is the recommended method for most users.

1.  In NextGen CRM, navigate to `Admin > Data Migration`.
2.  Select `Legacy CRM` as your source.
3.  Upload the backup file you created in the previous phase.
4.  The tool will analyze your data and provide a mapping preview. Review and confirm the mappings.
5.  Click **Start Migration**. The tool will run in the background, and you will be notified via email upon completion.

### Manual Data Migration

For users with highly customized data structures, a manual migration may be necessary. This involves exporting data from the Legacy CRM as CSV files and importing them into NextGen CRM.

1.  Export your data from the Legacy CRM in CSV format.
2.  In NextGen CRM, navigate to the relevant section (e.g., `Contacts`, `Deals`).
3.  Click **Import** and select the corresponding CSV file.
4.  Map the columns from your CSV file to the fields in NextGen CRM.
5.  Repeat this process for each data module.

## Phase 3: Configuration & Customization

### Replicating Custom Fields

If you used custom fields in the Legacy CRM, you will need to recreate them in NextGen CRM.

1.  Navigate to `Admin > Customization`.
2.  Select the module you want to add a custom field to.
3.  Click **+ Add Custom Field** and define the field properties.

### Setting Up User Roles & Permissions

Recreate your user roles and permissions to match your organizational structure.

1.  Navigate to `Admin > User Management > Roles`.
2.  Create new roles and define their permissions.
3.  Assign the roles to your users.

## Phase 4: Post-Migration Validation

### Data Integrity Checks

After the migration is complete, it is crucial to verify that your data has been transferred correctly.

*   **Spot-check records:** Compare a sample of records in NextGen CRM with the corresponding records in your Legacy CRM backup.
*   **Verify record counts:** Ensure the number of records in each module matches the number in your Legacy CRM.

### User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

Invite a group of your users to test the new system. Provide them with a checklist of common tasks to perform, such as:

*   Creating a new contact.
*   Updating a deal.
*   Running a report.

Gather feedback and address any issues that arise.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue: Some data fields were not migrated correctly.**

**Solution:** This can happen if the data types in the Legacy CRM and NextGen CRM do not match. Review your data mapping and ensure that all fields are correctly aligned. You may need to perform a manual data import for the affected fields.

**Issue: Users are reporting that they cannot access certain features.**

**Solution:** Check the user roles and permissions in NextGen CRM. Ensure that the roles have been configured correctly and assigned to the appropriate users.
