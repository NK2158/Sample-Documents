## Introduction to MySDK

MySDK is a powerful Software Development Kit that simplifies the integration of [mention core functionality, e.g., real-time data processing, secure authentication, AI model deployment] into your applications. It provides a set of pre-built functions and tools to accelerate your development process.

## Tutorial 1: Getting Started with MySDK

This tutorial will guide you through the initial setup of MySDK in your development environment and demonstrate how to make your first API call.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   `pip` package manager
*   A MySDK API Key (obtainable from your [developer dashboard](https://developer.mysdk.com/dashboard))

### Step 1: Install MySDK

```bash
pip install mysdk
```

### Step 2: Initialize MySDK

Create a new Python file (e.g., `app.py`) and add the following code:

```python
from mysdk import MySDK

# Replace with your actual API Key
api_key = "YOUR_MYSDK_API_KEY"
mysdk_client = MySDK(api_key=api_key)

print("MySDK client initialized successfully!")
```

### Step 3: Make Your First API Call

Let's fetch some basic user information:

```python
from mysdk import MySDK

api_key = "YOUR_MYSDK_API_KEY"
mysdk_client = MySDK(api_key=api_key)

try:
    user_info = mysdk_client.users.get_current_user()
    print("Current User Info:")
    print(user_info)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error fetching user info: {e}")
```

Run the script:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Tutorial 2: Handling Data with MySDK

This tutorial focuses on how to send and retrieve data using MySDK, covering common data operations.

### Sending Data

```python
from mysdk import MySDK

api_key = "YOUR_MYSDK_API_KEY"
mysdk_client = MySDK(api_key=api_key)

data_to_send = {
    "name": "New Record",
    "value": 123
}

try:
    response = mysdk_client.data.create(data_to_send)
    print("Data sent successfully:")
    print(response)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error sending data: {e}")
```

### Retrieving Data

```python
from mysdk import MySDK

api_key = "YOUR_MYSDK_API_KEY"
mysdk_client = MySDK(api_key=api_key)

try:
    # Retrieve all data (with optional filters)
    all_data = mysdk_client.data.list(limit=5)
    print("Retrieved Data:")
    for item in all_data:
        print(item)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error retrieving data: {e}")
```

## Tutorial 3: Advanced Features and Customization

Explore more advanced functionalities and how to customize MySDK for specific use cases.

### Webhooks Integration

Learn how to set up webhooks to receive real-time notifications from MySDK.

1.  **Register a Webhook Endpoint:**
    ```python
    # Example: Registering a webhook for 'data_created' event
    webhook_url = "https://your-app.com/mysdk-webhook"
    event_type = "data_created"
    try:
        mysdk_client.webhooks.register(url=webhook_url, event=event_type)
        print(f"Webhook registered for {event_type} at {webhook_url}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error registering webhook: {e}")
    ```
2.  **Handle Webhook Payloads:** Your application at `webhook_url` should be configured to receive and process POST requests from MySDK.

### Custom Error Handling

Implement robust error handling in your application to gracefully manage API errors.

```python
from mysdk import MySDK
from mysdk.exceptions import MySDKError, AuthenticationError, NotFoundError

api_key = "YOUR_MYSDK_API_KEY"
mysdk_client = MySDK(api_key=api_key)

try:
    # Example of an API call that might fail
    mysdk_client.users.get_user(user_id="non_existent_user")
except NotFoundError:
    print("User not found. Please check the user ID.")
except AuthenticationError:
    print("Authentication failed. Please check your API Key.")
except MySDKError as e:
    print(f"An SDK-specific error occurred: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```

## Best Practices and Troubleshooting

*   **Secure your API Key:** Never hardcode your API Key directly in client-side code. Use environment variables or secure configuration management.
*   **Handle Rate Limits:** Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff to gracefully handle `429 Too Many Requests` errors.
*   **Monitor Logs:** Regularly check your application and MySDK logs for errors and performance issues.
*   **Stay Updated:** Keep your MySDK SDK and dependencies updated to the latest versions.
